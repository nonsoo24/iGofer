# Daniel's Home Study Project

# HTML Web page for a SIMPLE routine in JAVASCRIPT

### Objectives the project:

* To be able to create a simple HTML file and markup

* To be able to give a simple styling (in line) to the HTML markup.

* Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript, such as Data types, Variables, Control structures and Iterative statements, Data structures.


### Procedures:

1. I created a folder on my computer named **PROJECT**.

2. I launched my text editor (Sublime text) and saved my work as **index.html** in the folder **PROJECT**.

3. In the body section of my HTML  markup, I included the JavaScript element's opening and closing tags (<script> and </script>)

4. I declared a static list (array) of animals within the script tags.

5. I created a **START** button which when clicked on prompts the **User** to guess the name of any animal among the static list of animals I decleared within the script tags. 

* I achieved this using the in-built functions **window.prompt** to prompt the **User** and also take the value entered by **User** to check.

6. If the value entered by the user is right or wrong, it **alerts** the **User** with a statement.

* I achieved this using the **If...Else Statement  and .includes** 

* I also included a **.toLowerCase** function which converts a name entered by the user to lower case. This helps solves the problem of case sensitivity.
